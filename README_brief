This program generates a pdf file (and optionally an html file) containing a table of student's names and their pictures, among other small details. The purpose is to help professors put names to their student's faces.

The following steps briefly outline how to do this. If you would like an in-depth how-to, read "README" instead.

1. Go to 'Detailed Class List' for your course in Banner Web and save it as a 'Web Page, Complete' in a newly created directory, e.g., "Section1/". Ensure that the only contents of the directory are a folder whose name ends in "_files", e.g., "Section1_files", and a single html file, e.g., "Section1.html". This directory is referred to as a "section". The name of this section will be used as the name of the generated pdf.
 
2. Transfer the section to your account on ccc.wpi.edu.

3. SSH into ccc.wpi.edu and execute the following command

$ /home/marcgreen/n2f/name2face Section1/

Replace "Section1/" with the name of the section downloaded and transferred.

4. Transfer the newly generated pdf, Section1.pdf, back to your current computer
